    // Let's say we have an array
    const players = ['Wes', 'Sarah', 'Ryan', 'Poppy'];

    // and we want to make a copy of it.
    const team = players;

    console.log(players, team); 
    // You might think we can just do something like this:
    //team[3] = 'Lux';

    // however what happens when we update that array?

    // now here is the problem!

    // oh no - we have edited the original array too!

    // Why? It's because that is an array reference, not an array copy. They both point to the same array!

    // So, how do we fix this? We take a copy instead!
    const team2 = players.slice(); 

    // one way

    // or create a new array and concat the old one in
    const team3 = [].concat(players);

    // or use the new ES6 Spread
    const team4 = [...players];
    team4[3] = "howdy" 
    console.log(team4); // ["Wes", "Sarah", "Ryan", "howdy"]

    const team5 = Array.from(players)
    
    // now when we update it, the original one isn't changed

    // The same thing goes for objects, let's say we have a person object

    // with Objects
    const person = {
      name: 'Wes Bos',
      age: 80
    };

    // and think we make a copy:
    const captain = person;
    captain.number = 99;

    // how do we take a copy instead?
    const cap2 = Object.assign({}, person, {number:99}); //overwite 
    console.log(cap2); //adds the number property into the person object

    // We will hopefully soon see the object ...spread
    const cap3 = {...person};

    // Things to note - this is only 1 level deep - both for Arrays and Objects. lodash has a cloneDeep method, but you should think twice before using it.
    const sara = {
      name: 'Sara',
      age: 100, 
      social: {
        github: 'saraxcoding',
        gmail: 'schodges0925'
      }
    }; // one level deep means, in this example, the first property; if you alter the other properties, it will ALSO affect the original object

    console.clear();
    console.log(sara); //Object {name: "Sara", age: 100, social: Object}

    const dev = Object.assign({}, sara);
    //typing dev.name = 'Sara H' in console will alter the dev name object NOT the sara name object
    
    const dev2 = JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(sara)); // avoids altering the original
